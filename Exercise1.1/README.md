# Task 1.1
## Acomplishments
<p>I successfully installed python and set up a virtual environment. I also wrote some extremely simple code. In addition to python itself I learned a little bit about pip and Ipython and tried them out.<p>

## Set backs
<p> I initially struggled to get virtualenvwrapper set up as my computer was unable to install it using pip. I eventually figures out how to install it with homebrew and had no issues from there<p>
