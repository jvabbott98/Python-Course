# Task 1.2 
## Step 1
<p>For recipe_1 I have chosen to use the dictionary data structure becuase its key-value pair format is great for storing
information about the recipe like its name, cooking time, and ingredeints.</p>

## Step 3
<p>For my all_recipes outer structure I decided to use a list because lists are mutable and therefore easy to update incase
I decide to add to my list of recipes or change the recipes it contains</p>
